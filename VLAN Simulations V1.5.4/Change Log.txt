WAN Network set up from R1 to R2. VLAN's alo set up off SW4. Different IP addresses for the VLAN's as I couldn't keep the same structure from the R1 LAN due to having no NAT in place.

VLAN 30 = 192.168.11.x
VLAN 40 = 192.168.10.x

The VLAN's follow the structure above now.

V1.5.5 will just be for making sure everything is working and set up correctly and all looks aestheticly pleasing.

V1.5.6 is to be decided on what to implement next.
