DHCP Server removed but fully implemented within R2.

All Library Users are automatically assigned an IP Address from R2 following the structure;

192.168.102.x

Switch/Host my need to be refreshed in order for the Host to obtain an IP Address from the DHCP Server.

Full communication still exists which is what I want. 

Version 1.5.8 will probably look at some sort of Authentication being put in place.
