Standard IP Access Control lists assigned to R1 for VLAN 30.

VLAN 20 (Business & Law) can't communicate with VLAN 30 (Administration) at all. However because of this, Hosts on VLAN 30 can't communicate with VLAN 20 either.

Could use Extended IP Access Control Lists however for now the the one ACL is sufficient.

Next Iteration - Try to create a WAN Network.
